MANAGER DASHBOARD ORDER VISIBILITY FIX
=====================================

PROBLEM:
The manager was not seeing customer orders in the manager dashboard, making it impossible 
to assign orders to baristas.

ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:
1. Orders loading without proper real-time updates in manager view
2. No fallback to localStorage if Firebase temporarily unavailable
3. Orders not being properly rendered with visibility into key details
4. Missing orderTime data for order sorting

FIXES APPLIED:

1. ENHANCED MANAGER DATA LOADING (staff-script.js)
   - Added loadManagerDataFromFirebase() for proper real-time listening
   - Added loadManagerDataFromLocalStorage() fallback
   - Added error handling with graceful fallback
   - Added console logging for debugging order loading
   - Fixed pending orders filter to include orders without status

2. IMPROVED ORDER CARD RENDERING (staff-script.js)
   - Orders now sorted by most recent first
   - Added order timestamp display (⏰ time received)
   - Added order details: customer name, phone, price, pickup time
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Clearer "Assign to Barista" button with emoji indicator
   - Added visual feedback on hover (shadow and slide animation)

3. UPDATED FIREBASE RULES (FIREBASE_RULES.json)
   - Added proper baristas read/write rules
   - Ensured both orders and baristas are readable by manager

4. ENHANCED ASSIGNMENT MODAL (staff-script.js)
   - Now displays customer name in order info
   - Better context for which order is being assigned

HOW TO TEST:
1. Go to menu.html
2. Place a new order
3. Login as Manager (credentials in staff-script.js)
4. You should see all orders immediately on the Manager Dashboard
5. Click "Assign to Barista" to assign orders to created baristas
6. The assigned orders will show "✓ Assigned to: [Barista Name]"

ORDERS FLOW:
Customer → Places Order (menu.html) → Firebase stores order with status: 'active'
Manager → Views all unassigned orders → Assigns to barista
Barista → Logs in → Sees only their assigned orders → Marks complete
Customer → Receives notification when order is ready

All changes maintain fallback to localStorage for offline functionality.
